Final project for intro to web dev course at PSU

I first started to work on the nav bar. I initialy had it placed at the very top of the page, and users could only see it up there. Once you pressed on a section it would take you down to that section, but the navbar would disapear. I didn't like that approach so I made the navbar on the side, and I set its position to be fixed. This made it so the navbar was always on display, and users could always press on the different sections, and therefore navigate the website. I eventually added the

The next thing I wanted to tackle was the different sections. I personally wanted to keep my website fairly minimal, and therefore opted to keep sections rather than have seperate pages for each individual section. This made it so my website was less cluttered with the various different pages, and just had one page.

The next thing I wanted to work on was the first section of my website. The first section focused primarily on a brief introduction, as well as my name. I wanted to make pop at the very beguining so I ended up adding some animations to it as well. I made sure that the overall theme of the website stayed relatively similar, and therefore created color variables that I would use for the entire project. I got the color combos from a website called, https://colorhunt.co/. The text animation I got from https://tobiasahlin.com/moving-letters/, and modified it a bit to make sure it fit my needs. I had to make sure my name was a different color, and make sure that the animation wasn't looping, which the original code was doing. At the bottom of the intro section, I included an email me button, that would open up your email, and you would be able to send an email to me.

The next part that I wanted to work on was the about me, for this I setup a different section, and made sure to add enough padding, as well as increase the height of the previous section so it would take up the whole screen. The about me section pretty much had a lot of componenets to it. I added a description about myself in a div, and made sure to use display flex for the about me section container. Inside of the contrainer I added another div with display grid, that showed the various technologies I have been using.

The next section I worked on was the footer. The footer was the easiest thing to implement. I made sure it only showed up at the bottom of the page, and made sure the information in it was centered.

I next worked on creating the experience section, which was also fairly easy to create. It was just a div that displayed information about my previous employment, and I used display flex for the container.

I continued my website on into the project section, that pretty much showed 3 of my recent projects. I decided to make this section into a card format. For each project I had a card, that showed information about the project, and links to it. The cards were created with display flexbox, and grid.

The last thing that I wanted to add to my website was the contact section, which would ask the user for their name, email, as well as what the message was. This was a little bit hard to create as I had to add backend to it, to make sure the logic worked properly in regards to sending emails. I had to use a online email service that would send me an email if the form was submited, and wrote javascript code for that.

Once the contact form was subimited, I would then take them to a "Thank you" page which would just confirmt that the email was sent, and delivered. That page would then redirect you back to the main website.

Overall this project wasn't that bad, and I had a great time creating it. I really enjoyed how mine came out, and I really liked the color shcme that I chose as it looked really good at the end product. I also liked my navbar, I added a hover effect to it, and I think it turned out really great. One thing I would change for this project is maybe have it be a react app. I think this way I wouldn't have to write as much code, as I think I was reusing a lot of code throughout this whole project, and creating a componenet would have been a lot more easier. Additionally I think maybe adding a "light" theme to the website would be pretty cool as well, I think it would be nice to see how with a press of a button I could change all of the colors on the site.
